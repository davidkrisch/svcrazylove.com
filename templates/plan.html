    The Plan
</%block>

<h4>Update January 18, 2014</h4>

It has been a while since Carolyn and I revisited The Plan.  We talk often
about the future. About what to do for hurricane season. About when and where
we'll land when we go back to work. And most of all about future cruising
plans.

Our choices are many and we add new ones to the list often.  I'll update this
as we talk through the decision.  Here are the ones we're seriously
considering:

<h5>Leave Crazy Love in Mexico</h5>

There are a few options here.  In La Paz we could leave Crazy Love on the the
hard.  In Banderas Bay or some other marina in Pacific Mexico we could leave
her in a marina - Banderas Bay, Ixtapa, Acapulco.

<h6>Pros</h6>
<ul>
    <li>This could be an inexpensive option.  Marina fees during the summer in Nuevo Vallarta are less than 30 cents per foot per day.</li>
    <li>We wouldn't have far to go to get home.</li>
</ul>
<h6>Cons</h6>
<ul>
    <li>Our current criuse would be done.  The boat would be stuck in place due to the threat of hurricanes. <em>This is a big deal for us</em>
    We're not ready to be done.  We've even talked about extending our cruise to the end of 2014.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Hawaii</h5>

Sometime before Mexican hurricane season, we'd load Crazy Love up with water and food and cross the Pacific to Hawaii.

<h6>Pros</h6>
<ul>
    <li>We've heard many good things about the trade wind sailing between Mexico and Hawaii.</li>
    <li>Our cruise would be extended through the summer and into the early fall.</li>
    <li>Hawaii is amazing!</li>
</ul>
<h6>Cons</h6>
<ul>
    <li>Our Hawaii cruising guide says that it is nearly impossible to get a slip in a marina.  If we can't
    get a permanent slip, then we'd have to sail back to the mainland.  That would be a significant trek.
    Before we strike this plan from the list we want to know more.  We've committed to calling every marina 
    in Hawaii to check for availability.  Since Crazy Love is so small we've had good 
    luck finding slips.</li>
    <li>If we can find a slip in HI, it is likely to be very expensive.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Central America</h5>

Continue south to Central America and leave the boat there when we go back to work.

<h6>Pros</h6>
<ul>
    <li></li>
</ul>
<h6>Cons</h6>
<ul>
    <li></li>
</ul>

<h5>Trailer or Ship Crazy Love home</h5>

Put Crazy Love on a ship or a trailer to be delivered to wherever we want.

<h6>Pros</h6>
<ul>
    <li></li>
</ul>
<h6>Cons</h6>
<ul>
    <li></li>
</ul>

<h5>Summer over in Mexico</h5>

Put the boat in a marina and spend the summer in Mexico.  Maybe explore inland areas by bus.

<h6>Pros</h6>
<ul>
    <li></li>
</ul>
<h6>Cons</h6>
<ul>
    <li></li>
</ul>

<h5>Cross to the South Pacific</h5>

Instead of Hawaii, go to the South Pacific.  We haven't seriously considered this so I don't know if its even possible.

<h6>Pros</h6>
<ul>
    <li></li>
</ul>
<h6>Cons</h6>
<ul>
    <li></li>
</ul>

<h4>About the Plan</h4>

<p>The initial plan is to depart San Diego and head North.  Our first goal is a lofty one...Mission Bay.
It might only be a 15 minute drive from our current home on Harbor Island, but we'll make it an 
adventurous 20 mile sail.  Going 4 knots, and having to tack against the wind and the waves, 
it will take us most of a day.
</p>

<p>
We will spend a few days anchored in Mission Bay and then we will head 25 or so miles up the coast 
to Oceanside Harbor.  There is no anchorage in Oceanside, so we will rent a guest slip for the princely
sum of thirty-some-odd bucks a night.  I think two nights in Oceanside will be enough to resupply, rest up
and plan the next leg of our journey to Dana Point.
</p>

<p>The trek from Oceanside to Dana Point is about 30 miles, again into the prevailing wind and waves.
After 72 hours anchored in Dana Point we will depart so we aren't arrested for overstaying our welcome.
I'm not kidding about the arrest part, seriously, read the "Dana Point" section 
<a href="http://www.blueanarchy.org/cruising/">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
Upon leaving Dana Point, we will attempt our first offshore destination.  Catalina Island is where
Carolyn and I were married and we've always dreamed of sailing there.  We would love to make it to Avalon Harbor
and stay on a mooring ball for Summer Solstice, but we'll see how that works out.
</p>

<p>
After Catalina, our plan is not set.  We might stay in the Channel Islands, stopping at whichever anchorages
suit the weather and our mood, or we might return to the mainland and continue our journey North.  By the end
of the summer I would like to get to San Francisco and anchor in McCovey Cove for a Giants game, but we'll see
how that works out.
</p>

<p>
By the end of August or early September we will be heading back to San Diego to prepare
for the next big leg of our journey, Mexico.  Carolyn and I think we will need about a month to prepare
ourselves and the boat to make the trip South for the Winter.  We will need to be more self-sufficient
in Mexico so we will need to answer a lot more what-if questions than we will sailing in California. 
For instance, "What if the engine doesn't start?"  In California, we can call SeaTow 
or BoatUS for a tow, but in Mexico, those services might not be available so we have to be able to help
ourselves. Fortunately, the systems on our boat are simple and a small cache of spares and tools should 
(fingers crossed) suffice. We'll see about this...
