    The Plan
</%block>

<h4>About the Plan</h4>

<p>The initial plan is to depart San Diego and head North.  Our first goal is a lofty one...Mission Bay.
It might only be a 15 minute drive from our current home on Harbor Island, but we'll make it an 
adventurous 20 mile sail.  Going 4 knots, and having to tack against the wind and the waves, 
it will take us most of a day.
</p>

<p>
We will spend a few days anchored in Mission Bay and then we will head 25 or so miles up the coast 
to Oceanside Harbor.  There is no anchorage in Oceanside, so we will rent a guest slip for the princely
sum of thirty-some-odd bucks a night.  I think two nights in Oceanside will be enough to resupply, rest up
and plan the next leg of our journey to Dana Point.
</p>

<p>The trek from Oceanside to Dana Point is about 30 miles, again into the prevailing wind and waves.
After 72 hours anchored in Dana Point we will depart so we aren't arrested for overstaying our welcome.
I'm not kidding about the arrest part, seriously, read the "Dana Point" section 
<a href="http://www.blueanarchy.org/cruising/">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
Upon leaving Dana Point, we will attempt our first offshore destination.  Catalina Island is where
Carolyn and I were married and we've always dreamed of sailing there.  We would love to make it to Avalon Harbor
and stay on a mooring ball for Summer Solstice, but we'll see how that works out.
</p>

<p>
After Catalina, our plan is not set.  We might stay in the Channel Islands, stopping at whichever anchorages
suit the weather and our mood, or we might return to the mainland and continue our journey North.  By the end
of the summer I would like to get to San Francisco and anchor in McCovey Cove for a Giants game, but we'll see
how that works out.
</p>

<p>
By the end of August or early September we will be heading back to San Diego to prepare
for the next big leg of our journey, Mexico.  Carolyn and I think we will need about a month to prepare
ourselves and the boat to make the trip South for the Winter.  We will need to be more self-sufficient
in Mexico so we will need to answer a lot more what-if questions than we will sailing in California. 
For instance, "What if the engine doesn't start?"  In California, we can call SeaTow 
or BoatUS for a tow, but in Mexico, those services might not be available so we have to be able to help
ourselves. Fortunately, the systems on our boat are simple and a small cache of spares and tools should 
(fingers crossed) suffice. We'll see about this...
