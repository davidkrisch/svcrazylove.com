Before Carolyn and I quit our jobs and moved onto the boat we told our friends
and family we were looking for a "Corona Commercial Christmas."  We found it,
in abundance, in San Jose del Cabo with our friends, and newlyweds, Chris and
Carol.  Vacation with these guys never disapppoints.  Chris and Carol, thank
you for joining us for Christmas!  We love you guys.

For the week surrounding Christmas, we rented a condo on the beach between Cabo
San Lucas and Cabo San Jose.  The condo development is called El Zalate.  The
condo had two big bedrooms, each with its own bathroom, a full kitchen and a
beautiful balcony with pool and ocean views to the South.  It could not have
been better...except the owners could have left a decently sharp knife for us
to use in the kitchen.

The weather all week was perfect.  About 80 degrees with clear skies and a
little breeze to make sure we didn't get too hot.  What do we do with nice
weather?  Of course we laid around the pool and went swimming in the ocean.  We
didn't stay in the condo complex the entire week though.

On Christmas eve, we took a two hour bus ride out to Cabo Pulmo - the only hard
coral reef in North America, so we've been told.  Unfortunately, the wind was
howling in the Sea of Cortez, so we were not able to see the reef in person.
Instead we snorkeled in Bahia Los Frailes.

We were disappointed that we couldn't snorkel on the reef, but mostly for Chris
and Carol's sake.  Rosie and I plan to be back in the Sea of Cortez when it
warms up in the spring, so it was no big deal for us.

While we vacationed in Cabo San Jose, Crazy Love was docked in Puerto Los Cabos
for the modest (after the lunacy of Cabo San Lucas) fee of $35.10 per night.
When the 'vacation' was over we returned to the boat, cleaned her up, had
one last meal at El Marinero Borracho (The Drunken Sailor) before getting
back to our grand adventure.

The plan WAS to head up into the Sea of Cortez - La Paz specifically - but we
made a gametime change in plans that significantly effected our latitude.
We're in Nuevo Vallarta, right next to Puerto Vallarta.  It turns out that our
gametime change of plans was the right move except for the big lump in the side
of my head.

We hope you had a merry Christmas and wish you a happy and healthy 2014.
