__Getting to San Francisco__

When we left the Petaluma Marina, we motored down the Petaluma River to anchor
at McNears Beach for a night. The anchorage at McNears Beach was calm, warm,
and uncrowded.  We relaxed for the evening and headed to Quarry Beach on Angel
Island the following morning. Quarry Beach had a significant breeze, a crazy
tidal current, and lots of waves from the ferry traffic.  It was an
uncomfortable night at anchor - one of those nights where we had to hang on to
avoid falling out of our beds in the middle of the night.  Even though we were
tired in the morning, we were happy to be heading to the big city for a few
nights.

__Brewpubs, Baseball in San Francsico__

We had a reservation for 5 nights (Tuesday to Sunday) at South Beach Marina
right next to AT&T Park.  When we got the reservation, we had no idea how great
this spot was going to be.  Besides being next to the ballpark, it was close to
public transportation, breweries, and the embarcadero.  So many great things to
do, what did we do first?  Brew pubs of course!

Less than a mile walk from the marina is [21st
Amendment](http://21st-amendment.com/the-restaurant/).  After a few pints
there, we went around the corner to the [Thirsty Bear](http://thirstybear.com/)
for dinner.  Sitting in the bar, I had an excellent burger and the tasters. Given
the chance, I'd go back.

The Red Sox were in town for a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday series, so on our way back to
the marina, we stopped in right field to watch a few innings of free baseball.

We had originally planned to anchor in McCovey Cove for the day game on
Wednesday, the 21st, but decided to go to the game instead.  Nosebleed tickets
on Stubhub were only $14, so we bought three.  Amy drove in from Fresno to join
us for the game.  Before the game we met up with our friend Christine (currently
of San Francisco, formerly of San Diego) at [Public
House](http://www.publichousesf.com/).  Good times would be had with Christine.

After the game we headed to Potrero Hill for the [Connecticut
Yankee](http://www.yelp.com/biz/connecticut-yankee-san-francisco).  After the
pricey beer at the breweries and the ballpark, it was nice to be at a locals
bar where refreshment can be had for 5 bucks.

It turned out to be a good night out with a little hiccup at the end.  Carolyn,
Amy, and I didn't follow Christine's directions to get back to the marina on
the bus, so we ended up walking about 3 miles home.  Oops!  Its all part of the
Crazy Love adventure.

__Golden Gate Park__

For Thursday, we planned to spend the afternoon and evening in [Golden
Gate Park](http://www.golden-gate-park.com/).  We took the train to get there 
mid-afternoon and walked West to see the beach and windmills.  We saw the windmills
from a mile offshore before we passed under the gate, so we wanted to see them
in person.  They're impressive up close.

In the middle of the park is the [California Academy of
Sciences](http://www.calacademy.org/). Rosie and I enjoy museums, but the
tickets for this one are $35.  Fortunately, they have a
[Nightlife](http://www.calacademy.org/events/nightlife/) event every Thursday
evening where the tickets run $12 and, and, wait for it...they set up a bar on
every floor with a specialty cocktail.  If there was an event with booze you
knew Rosie and I would find it.

__Toronado__

On Friday morning we saw The World's End and were so inspired that we headed
off to Toronado for a pint.  Toronado San Francisco was one of my "wish list"
items for this trip and it didn't disappoint.  They even had [Death &
Taxes](http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/763/2306).

After a few at Toronado, we moved on to, not greener, but other pastures that
need not be discussed here.

__Three Musuems & a Failed Attempt at a Cable Car Ride__

On Saturday, Carolyn and I started the morning with a walk on the Embarcadero
to the [Ferry Plaza Farmer's
Market](http://www.ferrybuildingmarketplace.com/farmers_market.php) which
definitely takes the cake for best farmer's market we've seen in California.
They had everything: pizza, sandwiches, mexican, italian, and more on the hot
food side, and everything you can expect on the farmer's side. We had a pizza
for lunch and came home with Chanterelle and Shitake mushrooms and marinated
pepper relish.  On a later trip we picked up sourdough and parmesan.

After the market, we walked through the financial district towards China Town
hoping to catch a ride on a cable car.  While trying to find the cable car stop
we ran into the Cable Car museum.  I never thought about the meaning of cable
car, so I was surprised to learn that cable cars are propelled by a cable
moving underneath the street.

Then we tried to get on a cable car.  We waited at the stop nearest the museum
and saw three cable cars, but they were full and the drivers told us to "catch
the next one."  Bummer! No cable car ride for us, so we walked toward
Fisherman's Wharf.

At Aquatic Park is the [San Francisco Maritime
Museum](http://www.nps.gov/safr/index.htm).  We took the free tour which
amounts to walking down the pier and looking at the ships from afar.  We didn't
pay to go on the ships because we had other sights in mind.

Onward we marched to Fisherman's Wharf.  It was crazy busy!  We got out of the
crowd by going in [Boudin](http://www.boudinbakery.com/Museum/Bakery_Tour).
They have a museum and bakery viewing area on the second floor that's worth a
visit.  The museum covers more than just the bakery. The company is so old,
there was a bunch of history about the 1906 earthquake that Carolyn and I had
been looking for.

At that point Christine caught up with us.  We headed to the bar where the
Irish Coffee was first served in the U.S. - [The Buena
Vista](http://www.thebuenavista.com/irishcoffee.html).  In addition to
out-of-this-world Irish Coffee, they have excellent Guinness and clam chowder.
Then we were off to China Town for dinner.

Sunday morning arrived and we weren't the least bit prepared to vacate our
slip in the city.  I extended our stay by one night - for the grand sum of $35.
Sunday was dedicated to provisioning for two nights at anchor - one at Angel Island
and another at Treasure Island, but we'll leave that for the next post.
