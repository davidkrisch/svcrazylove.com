After weeks of street tacos, burritos, restaurant enchiladas and coastal
Mexico's version of pizza I was in the mood for a taste from home. I went to one
of my comfort food favorites, scalloped potatoes and ham.  This is my pressure
cooker version.

__Scalloped Potatoes and Ham__

* Potatoes, peeled and sliced ... about 4 
* Ham (in this case deli sliced ham as that is what we had), a couple slices 
* 1 Onion, sliced then coarsely chopped 
* 2 tblsp Butter 
* 2 tblsp Flour 
* 1-2 cups Milk 
* Cheese, a couple slices of manchego and American 
* Salt and pepper

Layer the sliced potatoes, ham, and onion in the pressure cooker.  (1 layer
potatoes, then ham, then onion, and then a 2nd layer potatoes, etc).

Cover with water. Bring to pressure 15 psi for 4 minutes.  Let the pot naturally release
and pour off excess water.

In a separate pan melt the butter.  Stir in the flour a little at a time making a [roux](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roux). Then slowly add the milk
making a sauce.  Bring to boil till it starts to thicken then lower heat.  Add
cheese until melted and season with salt and pepper.

Pour sauce over the potatoes, onion, and ham.
