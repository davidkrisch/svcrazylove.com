title: San Diego to Mission Bay
date: 2013-05-31

After a final trip to the grocery store with my sister Amy (Thank you Amy!) and
a few last minute maintenance and organizing items, we are underway.  Carolyn
and I have given up our slip and turned in our keys at Harbor Island West
Marina.  That officially makes us nomads.

Here's what it took for us to get here in quasi-chronological order:

**January** 

* Carolyn quit her job

**January through April**

* Carolyn, her sisters and Mom get our condo ready to rent

**April**

* I quit my job in hopes of getting the boat ready
* Take the mast off the boat for rig and lighting work

**Late April**

* Movers take a few pieces of furniture and a few boxes to be stuffed in a 5x7x7 storage unit
* We meet our property manager
* The property manager takes a grand total of 3 hours to rent our apartment
* Carolyn and I have 30 hours to get the rest of our stuff from the condo into our cars
* We move onto the boat, with all our remaining things packed in the car

**May**

* Haul the boat out
* Sell Carolyn's car 
* Sell Dave's car
* Finish provisioning and organizing

That's a long list of the big things we did and it doesn't cover the dozens of little
jobs we did to enable the big things.  Anyways...the preparation is done and we are
underway. Woohoo!

We pulled out of our slip at 1:20pm and arrived in Mission Bay at about 8:30pm.  The trip
was uneventful - that's a good thing - except for passing this Japanese Navy ship as
we exited San Diego Bay.

We sailed in shifty, but light, southwest winds for the 16 mile ride from Harbor Island
to Mission Bay.  We plan to spend the weekend anchored in Mission Bay and head to 
Oceanside on Monday if weather permits.
