Whether at anchor or at a marina you meet friends along the way and it sure is
nice to share the cooking duties.  At anchor you might be a bit more limited to
what provisions you have, but I usually have what it takes to put a pot of
[chowder](2013-08-11_Chowder_.html)
or [Mom's chili](2013-08-01_Fresh_vs_Canned_and_Dried.html) together and both these dishes make plenty to go around
for up to 6 people.

For a gathering at a marina you have the benefit of more ingredients.  Even at
the mini supers here in Mexico I was able to put together an appetizer to share.

__Chicken Salad Roll Ups__

image[cover_quiche, potluck, Beautiful pepper and onion from the Sunday Market.]

* 1 Roasted Chicken, meat removed from the bones and shredded (Tu Pollo in La Cruz or your local rotisserie) 
* 1 cup Mayo (with lime is most common here in Mexico)
* 2 tsp Mustard 
* 2 tsp Pickle juice 
* 1 Red pepper, diced 
* 3 Green onions, diced 
* 1/4 bunch Cilantro, stems removed and chopped 
* Salt and pepper to taste 
* 1 tblsp or to taste Indian seasoning 
* Tortillas
* Lettuce.. For garnish

Mix the mayo mustard and pickle juice in with the shredded chicken. Add in the
diced  vegetables and cilantro. Season to taste with the salt, pepper and Indian
seasoning.

Spread on a tortilla, roll up and cut into finger sandwich size pieces.

**I really thought I took a picture, but apparently not.  

__Indian Spice Mix__

* Paprika (3)
* Chili powder (3)
* Turmeric (2)
* Garam Masala (2)

On another occasion we got together with the Lilo for brunch.  One of my
favorite recipes from our land life is Paula Deen's [hash brown quiche](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/paula-deen/hash-brown-quiche-recipe.html). Here it
is adapted for the boat. 

Warning this one takes a lot of stove fuel so probably best saved for a marina stay with access to fuel refill.



__Hash Brown Quiche__

* Hash brown potatoes, rehydrate 1 cup dry (about 2 cups) 
* Butter, 1/2 to 1 stick 
* Red pepper, diced 
* Onion, diced 
* Eggs, 6 
* American cheese 2-3 slices chopped into small pieces (queso Amarillo as its called in Mexico but if you had cheddar this would be extra tasty)
* Milk, about 1 cup 
* Salt and pepper

Sauté the pepper and onion in the frying pan in a few tablespoons butter till
soft. Add a few more tablespoons butter and the potatoes.  Cook over high heat for a few
minutes till potatoes are coated, then press the potatoes into the bottom of the pan forming a crust.  Salt
the potatoe crust.  Let cook over medium heat for 5 minutes or so.

Scramble the eggs and milk. Mix in salt and pepper and cheese.

Pour egg mixture over the potatoes and cook over medium to low heat till the
eggs are cooked through. This takes about 45 minutes.  Cover with foil the last
10 minutes to ensure top is cooked as well.

When you are in the mood for a good steak it sure is nice to have friends with a
grill on the boat. We ventured to a local carnicería and the fish market in La Cruz. We
supplied the surf and turf, hoping they well made up for the propane used and
chef skills of the grillman, Bryan.

There is nothing like good food to bring good people together on land or at sea.
