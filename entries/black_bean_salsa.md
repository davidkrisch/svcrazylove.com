As mentioned in our Honolulu post, the folks on B dock were very nice to
include us in their progressive potluck.  This recipe is one we've used for
years in my family.  Always a winner!

This is great served with chips or without. I've heated leftovers for black
bean burritos or its delicious served over grilled fish.
