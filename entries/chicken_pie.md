Ok so it's really just creamy chicken soup with biscuits on the side.  If I were
a different cook I might try dropping the biscuit dough on the top, creating a
dumpling topping, but I have an aversion to soggy bread and love my "crust" or
biscuits on the side.

I had a potato and couple carrots that needed cooking so I threw this together
last night after we anchored at McNears on San Pablo Bay.


__Creamy Chicken Soup__

* 1 can chicken 
* 1 can cream of chicken and mushroom soup condensed + can water 
* 1 potato, peeled and cubed 
* 2 carrots, peeled and diced 
* 1/2 onion, diced 
* 1 clove garlic, minced 
* Montreal steak seasoning to taste

Everything goes in the pressure cooker.  Bring up to 15 psi and keep at pressure
4 minutes then turn heat off until pressure naturally releases.

While the soup is cooking you can fry up the biscuits. Yep I said fry.


__Biscuits__

*  1 cup self rising flour 
*  2-3 tablespoons shortening 
*  1/2 cup milk

I mix a heaping tablespoon of powdered milk into the flour, then add the
shortening and gradually add water till it forms biscuit dough.  Form into 4
flat patties. Pan fry in additional shortening. Take them on and off medium heat
to prevent burning. About 4 minutes a side.

Not one of our heart healthiest meals but very good.

I've made the biscuits for breakfast before as well. Served with ham and cheese.
They are a great bread substitute on the boat when a bakery isn't close by.
