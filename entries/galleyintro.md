Yes of course this 26 ft boat sports a galley! It has been fun provisioning and 
creating meals along this journey.  In this section we'll share some of our ideas for 
meals, recipes, and provisions.  I hope some of them sound good enough to prepare for 
yourself on a boat, camping, or in your home kitchens.

The galley on Crazy Love is:

* Two burner alcohol stove (burns denatured alcohol)
* Built in cooler (no refrigeration, but it does hold ice up to 48 hours)
* Hand pump sink (connected to our 20 gallon water tank)

We have 3 pots:
 
* Teapot
* Fry pan (non stick)
* Pressure Cooker

The cooking and eating utensils are minimal but work!

We keep a stocked pantry with dry goods, some canned goods, and as you've noticed we add 
fresh produce as often as we can find farmer's markets and grocers along the way.
