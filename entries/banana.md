Hungry for something dessert like that didn't come from a package of cookies, I looked at
our provisions and thought hmmm...

__Banana Quesadilla__

* tortilla
* peanut butter
* banana
* brown sugar
* Cinnamon Sugar*

Spread peanut butter on a tortilla.  Layer with cut up banana, sprinkle brown sugar and 
the cinnamon sugar mix.

Heat in the pan like a quesadilla, folding it in half, till browned, warmed through, and sugar starts to melt.

Serve warm.  1 quesadilla served both of us a tasty dessert.



__Cinnamon Sugar__* - also a mix I have in the spice rack

* Cinnamon (3)
* Granulated Sugar (2)
* Nutmeg (1/2)
