The biggest attraction we wanted to see in Monterey was the Aquarium.  Carolyn
was there 10 or so years ago, but I've never been.  Everything I've read says
it isn't to be missed and after going there, I agree...it is a world class
tourist attraction. My family also has never been to the aquarium so they drove
out to meet us for the weekend, but before the family arrived we had to do the
obligatory brewery trips.

__Brewery Hopping__

We arrived in Monterey on Thursday morning, July 25th, and anchored out for the
evening.  On Friday morning, before any of the family arrived, we called the
harbor patrol and secured a slip in the Monterey Municipal Marina for the
weekend.  The slip was only $17.50 per night making our total for the stay $70.
We pulled into the slip at 9am, cleaned ourselves up, and hopped on the Route 20
bus towards Marina, CA.

In Marina is [English Ales Brewing](http://www.englishalesbrewery.com).  They have the
typical industrial area brewery with a big 'cafe' attached.  I had the fish and
chips, Carolyn had the Reuben on rye.  It was delicious.  My favorite beer was
the Black Hound Stout.  After lunch and a few beers, we headed back towards
Monterey on the bus.

Our next stop was [Cannery Row Brewing
Company](http://www.canneryrowbrewingcompany.com).  They didn't have much in the way
of house brews, but their tap list was similar to what you'd find at Yardhouse.
If you're touring Cannery Row, its worth a stop. 

__Monterey Bay Aquarium__

On Saturday, my parents arrived in time for lunch and Amy joined us after the
gang was already at the aquarium.  On Saturday and Sunday evenings, the
aquarium does an event they call "Evenings by the Bay" where they stay open
until 8pm with live jazz and a cash bar after 6pm.  Maybe it seems out of
character for Carolyn and I, but the prospect of a bar in a typically
children's attraction was too good to pass up.  We decided in advance that we
were staying until closing. The event lived up to our expectations.  By 6:30pm,
most of the screaming 8 year olds were gone so I could drink my Prohibition Ale
and take in the amazing jellyfish exhibit.

After the aquarium kicked us out at 8pm, we were ready for dinner, so we headed
to the "other" brewery in town: [Peter
B's](http://www.portolahotel.com/dining/brewpub).  After dinner it was off to bed 
back at the marina.

On Sunday, Amy was heading home, and Carolyn and I planned to do the 17 Mile Drive 
with my parents.

__Point Pinos Lighthouse__

At the tip of the Monterey Peninsula is Point Pinos.  Crazy Love had rounded Point
Pinos 72 hours earlier, so a stop at the lighthouse for a closer look sounded like
a good idea.

__17 Mile Drive__

Around the corner from the lighthouse is the entrance to the 17 Mile Drive.
Along the drive is a handful of famous golf courses and a breath-taking stretch
of coastline.

__Monday, Maintenance Day__

On Monday, Carolyn and I had a full day of boat chores.  Nothing to see here. Move along

Next stop, Santa Cruz.  20 miles North of Monterey.
