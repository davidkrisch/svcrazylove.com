**Work in Progress**

Neiafu, Anchorages 11 and 30

*Friday, September 14th*

I was lucky to have a birthday shared with friends from Kuan Yin and Shamata
at the best view in town as its name suggests Bella Vista.  A bottle of wine
and lunch and in true Crazy Love style moved on to a mini pub crawl.  Hey you
only turn 42 once.  The night ended with dancing at Basque Tavern.

*Saturday*

We caught another rugby game at Refuge (those Springboks actually won against
the All Blacks), ate more fish and chips,

*Sunday*

Invited aboard Desiderata for Sunday roast with Stuart and Julia.  These folks
know how to put on a 3 course dinner and let me tell you it was the most
delicious meal I had in Nieafu - crab topped with caviar over fresh tomatoes
and a pork roast (they called it crackling pig) the make my mouth water as I
write this.

*Monday*

Tonga celebrated the Prince’s birthday and yet another friend from Samoa
came through Tonga, drinks and games aboard Charabia with Mark and Helen.

Our visas were due to expire soon, therefore a quick trip to immigration for an
extension.  Granted quite easily for $60 TOP per person per month.  We extended
an additional month through Oct 23.  Some provisioning and we were ready for a
few more anchorages away from town.

Anchorage 19, Tapana - Wednesday we headed out to Tapana, a highly recommended
spot by a number of sailors.  We arrived and felt at home immediately.   There
are a few boats moored here year round and a few moorings up for grabs for a
price.  Anchoring away from the crowd seemed like a good plan.  Anchor set in a
somewhat sandy bottom and a swim was in order. The next day greeted us with the
most rain I’ve seen come down in a day.  Between buckets and pots we collected
6 or so gallons of the best tasting rain water. The sun came back out Friday
and the swimming was great, although not much coral.  A school of squid swam by
and looked completely surreal.  Friday night ended with a lovely happy hour
sunset with the local crew - Sherry, Larry, Carl and Mike as well as MIke’s
friend Margot.  The next day Dave dinghied us ashore and we took the 3 or so
mile walk back to town, mostly to get a feel of this side of the island.  There
were cows.. .lots of cows, beautiful vistas and so many helpful Tongans
stopping to offer us a ride, looking quite baffled when we were content to walk
on.   An additional rum bottle acquired, lunch and we trekked it back.  We were
so content at an
