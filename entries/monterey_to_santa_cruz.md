title: Monterey to Santa Cruz
date: 2013-08-03

Sorry for the lack of update since we got to Santa Cruz.  Our inverter (the
gadget that allows us to charge the laptop on the boat) got wet on the trip
from San Simeon to Monterey. In addition to smoke and a high pitched whine,
the inverter no longer charges the laptop.  I think it will go in the round file
soon.  A marine grade unit is in our future.  Anyhow...on with the narrative.

After a day of maintenance in Monterey Municipal Marina on Monday, we headed
for Santa Cruz.  We tried to get fuel, but the line at the fuel dock was
significant.  Since the wind was blowing 10 knots from the West, we decided
to wait until the next port for fuel.  The trip to Santa Cruz is about 20
miles which took us a little less than 5 hours.  It was a great sail and
there's not much more to say about it except that if more folks had
Tuesdays like ours, there would be fewer aggressive drivers in the world.

Santa Cruz has great weather.  Ever since we left Santa Barbara, I've been cold
and the sun has mostly refused to show itself.  Since we arrived in Santa Cruz,
the temperature has warmed and the sun has come out every day.  That's lead to
some lovely sunny afternoons anchored (for free!) off the beach where we get to
hear the constant sounds of the [Santa Cruz Beach
Boardwalk](http://www.beachboardwalk.com/).  On Wednesday, we rowed Peeps (the
dinghy) to the public landing on the wharf and headed to the Farmer's Market to
reload on fruits and veggies.  We also picked up a most excellent piece of
Albacore Tuna that Rosie applied some sorcery to in the galley and made
our most excellent meal of our trip so far.  Note to self: We need to start fishing!

__Boardwalk Carnival__

On Thursday, Rosie convinced me we needed some carnival rides.  I've never been
much for roller coasters more violent than Pirates of the Caribbean, so we went
on the "Pirate Ship," a tame _family_ friendly ride.  After the ride was over - I 
didn't have a terrible time - I got my choice of rides.  I chose the corndog and
a beer ride.  It was an outstanding corn dog. I really forgot how good carnival 
food is.  Maybe I'll go back to the Del Mar Fair one of these days.

On our way back to the boat,
[Ideal](http://www.yelp.com/biz/ideal-bar-and-grill-santa-cruz-2) had a decent
happy hour for a beach bar, so we stopped for a few pints.  A few pints takes
the edge off the 500 yard row back to the boat.  We didn't even get wet. Hah!

Right now, its Saturday, I'm sitting in the [515 Kitchen and
Cocktails](http://515santacruz.com/) drinking a Uncle Dave's Rye IPA, writing
this blog entry, and waiting for the laptop to charge.  Not a bad way to spend a
Saturday afternoon.  I hope your's is just as nice.
