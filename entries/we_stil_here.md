We're still in Hawaii but we're 95% ready to go.  The last couple weeks have
been quite busy.  This is what we've been up to:

* New sails fitted & tested!!! They are glorious.
* Engine repair complete (new shifter installed, fuel tank reinstalled)
* Car died & donated to Make a Wish Foundation
* Broke wind vane, repaired wind vane
* Replaced gaskets - hatches, ports, and engine access
* Revived the head - sea water pump didn't work but we fixed it for $0
* Galley water pump doesn't work, but we've ordered a replacement from San Diego
* Successfully tested navigation lights
* Installed shelf in closet to store fresh stores
* Resurrect the depth sounder.  It only needed a little more anti-freeze.
* Replaced the other jib sheet lead car after the sheave broke during our first day sail
* Moved dinghy to marina (Thank you Chris!) and launched for the first time
* Stocked boat with water (bye bye waterline) and dry stores.
* Given notice to Kailua landlords and marina management
* More going away parties than we can count - we've made a lot of great friends in Hawaii

Here's what we need to accomplish before we can head South:

* Vacate apartment
* Move everything else onto the boat - kitchen & clothes
* Organize everything on the boat
* Provision fresh produce
* Get exit papers from Customs
* Test wind vane under sail
* Close bank, electric, gas, etc accounts
* Check the weather
* Throw off the dock lines already!

Fingers crossed, we head South to Fanning Island next week.
