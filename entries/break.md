Dave and I were itching to get out on the sea again. We decided a few days at
anchor before our visitors arrived were necessary. After our return from
Guadalajara and a birthday celebration for Will on Thalassi, we loaded up the
boat and headed to Islas Tres Marietas where we heard the snorkeling could be
great.

We pulled in on a Friday evening and grabbed one of the few bright orange
mooring balls provided for boaters by the national park. It was a lovely sunset
with a dinner from our favorite chicken spot in La Cruz, Tu Pollo. We awoke
early, had a lovely breakfast of Dave's pancakes, saw the water was a bit
choppy and cool yet for a snorkel and proceeded with a lazy morning. It seems
this meant a post breakfast nap for me. I awoke to Dave having a very stern
discussion with someone. I peeked my head out and the little bay was full of
boats and people, snorkeling, paddle boarding, kayaking and generally having a
good time.  Apparently one of the tour boats was in need of the mooring ball
and they were not taking no for an answer. Rather than share the mooring with a
rather large boat we took off for anchorage across the way at Punt Mita where
we spent the next couple nights very relaxed.  We headed back to La Cruz and
the arrival of our guests.
