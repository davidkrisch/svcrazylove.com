title: Farmers' Market Bounty

We timed our visit to Santa Cruz last week just right for a return visit to the
Wednesday downtown farmers' market.

It was great to load up on fresh veggies for what we thought at the time was going to be 
our longest voyage south, direct to Avila.

I saw the San Marzano tomatoes at one of the stands and just couldn't resist
tasting them fresh and a dinner idea was formed.

While in town we picked up some chicken tenders at the local supermarket.


__San Marzano Tomato Sauce with Chicken Tenders__

* 1 pound Chicken Tenders 
* [Montreal Steak Seasoning](http://www.mccormick.com/Spices-and-Flavors/Grill-Mates/Seasoning-Blends/Grill-Mates-Montreal-Steak-Seasoning)
* San Marzano tomatoes, 8 peeled and diced
* Summer squash (1 green and 1 yellow), diced 
* 3 cloves garlic, minced 
* 1/2 Onion, diced 
* Olive oil 
* 2-4 tsp Italian Spice Mix*
* Salt 
* Pepper

I pounded the tenders flat with Dave's mug. Seasoned them with olive oil and
Montreal steak seasoning and pan fried them till cooked through.  Set aside.

Everything else went into the frying pan and was cooked until the sauce took form,
pressing and smashing the tomatoes as they cooked down.

I keep a few packs of salt squared away in a zip lock. These were definitely
needed for the tomatoes.

This sauce turned out fantastic.  It had been a long time since we had sauce that
didn't come from a can or jar.  Once the sauce was seasoned to taste and simmered for a few minutes, 
I threw half the cooked chicken in.  Served over pasta with a few shavings of asiago. Paired with a fresh
Italian baguette and another terrific farmers' market salad.

The other half of the chicken I saved for the next evening's meal.
