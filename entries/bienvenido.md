title: Bienvenido a Mexico!
date: 2013-11-20

Dave and I left the Zuniga jetty around 12:15 pm on Monday and headed south!  It
was perfect wind and weather.

We did get to try out our windpilot.  Actually more than try it out.  It
essentially took us all the way to Ensenada with only a few hours in the middle
of the night when we relied on our old buddy Otto (tiller pilot).

Tuesday morning, at the entrance to Bahía Todos Santos(All Saints Bay), we were
greeted by a pod of dolphins. There were no less than 100 swimming around us
with a few playing in our bow wake.  What a wonderful welcome!

We pulled into the "guest dock" of [Cruiseport Village Marina](http://ects.enseit.com/ecpvmarina/) in Ensenada around
10:30 am and headed to the office.  The staff were very friendly and set us up
with a guest slip for 3 nights and as part of their service, they walk you
through the CIS (Centro Integral de Servicios).  They made all the copies
necessary of our boat registration, passports, and insurance as well as helped
us complete the port entry and exit papers.  They drove us to the office and
ensured we went to the correct agency windows in the correct order.  We now
have a tourist visa, paid our port fees, and received our temporary import
permit for Crazy Love.  This took us about an hour.  It probably would have
taken Dave and I much longer on our own.  I definitely recommend this marina for
any cruisers.

After our paper work was squared away we headed out in search of good food and a
celebratory drink. The empanadas were delicious and the margaritas cold, tart,
and strong.

Although not far from San Diego, we feel like we're in a completely different
country, well we are... Bienvenido a Mexico!
