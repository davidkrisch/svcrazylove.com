title: Finally Ready
date: 2018-06-12

Well it has been over a month since our sayonara party and yes we're still here
in HI ... but not for much longer.

The boat is finally to a point where we're ready to throw off the lines and
sail off \- I know you've heard this before but I feel really good about our
final plan!  Its been a very busy few weeks with a few unanticipated boat
repairs (as always!).

This is the plan:

- Final walk through and turn in apartment keys Friday, 15 June
- Visit Customs & Border Protection for our exit papers Friday, 15 June
- Fresh provisions Saturday, 16 June
- Return rental car Saturday, 16 June
- Relax at marina Sunday with any final boat fixes
- Monday, 18 June which is only a little more than 2 weeks late,  the usual for cruisers ... sail off (of course the forecast has very light winds at this point... but fingers crossed). Our first destination - Fanning Island of Kiribati.

Aloha!
