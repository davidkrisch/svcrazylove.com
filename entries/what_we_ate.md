Provisioning success!  No refrigeration, no major grocery stops and we ate very
well for 3 weeks.  The following is my food diary.

On Sunday November 17 we left Half Moon Marina in San Diego after a grocery stop
and for a pizza of course.  We started this habit at the beginning of our
cruising in May.  The night or afternoon before heading out on a long voyage we
order an extra large pizza and we have excellent leftovers for Day 1 and
sometimes Day 2!

Let the cold beer and tacos flow!

We arrived Cabo San Lucas on Sunday 12/8.  A supermercado is one block from the marina where
we can reload on the staples. 

- All of the meals above were not the only food... snacks such as peanut butter
and cheese crackers, cookies, mixed nuts, trail mix and other shelf stable
goodies supplemented our eats.  We finished up our boxed wine on Thanksgiving
day.  Note to self, provision more wine. I believe Dave ate an entire jar of peanut
butter himself... we almost went through 2 small jars.

- The water tank provided ample drinking water for the two of us.  We were
very conservative to only use this water for drinking and cooking (and even then
we would boil pasta in 1 part sea water/ 1 part fresh).  Dishes are washed in
sea water.   The marina water in Cabo has been through their own treatment
system, we have tested it and decided to fill up (but added just a tiny amount
of chlorox just in case.)  Testing means:  I gave Dave a glass of water and he seems fine!


TVP= textured vegetable protein

Boatmeal=  Oats, granola, and dried cranberries mixed with powdered milk and water, sprinkled with cinnamon, nutmeg, sugar or brown sugar.  Allow to sit for the oats to soften.  Served cold or should we say boat temperature.  Recipe courtesy [atomvoyages](http://www.atomvoyages.com/planning/recipes-and-provisioning.html)

Eggs= powdered, although now if we choose we can find unrefrigerated fresh eggs here in Mexico
