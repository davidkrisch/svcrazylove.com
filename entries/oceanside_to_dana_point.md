After a great happy hour sendoff at Monterey Bay Canners in Oceanside Harbor
with our friends Terry and Jeff, Dave and I set sail for Dana Point.  Looking
at the course, it is 22 miles to the Northwest.  The forcast was for 5kt to
15kt winds from the Northwest.  Unfortunately that made for a close hauled bash
up the coast.  We expected much of our journey this summer to be like this,
but we didn't expect it to be quite as __slow__ and __wet__ as it was.

Dave and I pulled out of Oceanside just after 9am in less than 10kts of breeze
from the Northwest.  We slowly made our way up the coast with one turnaround to
rescue a fender that went overboard.  This gives me confidence that should I go
overboard, Dave _might_ be able to pull me out of the water. By 6pm we still
had 8 miles to go and the waves seemed to be getting bigger. We decided to furl
the jib and motor the rest of the way to Dana Point. Four hours later (10pm),
in the dark we pulled into Dana Point Harbor.  Dave discovered that our VHF
actually transmits as well as receives and cleared our anchorage with the
harbormaster. After this bash up the coast, we have a few items that need our
attention on the boat, so we will spend a few extra days here before heading to
Avalon. For now, it is a day of rest.
