title: Visiting Crew
date: 2013-10-22

This past week we were excited to welcome some visiting crew onto Crazy Love.  My mom, my sister 
Michele, and our nephews Theo and Chaz took advantage of fall break to visit us during our
stay in San Diego.

Theo could not believe we live on a boat so we had to show him around and of course take him
out for a sail.

Theo liked the boat and the sailing but told me we should definitely do something about 
that smell (from the head).  We do have a bit of plumbing to fix before we head to Mexico.  

Theo I promise its on the list!!

Chaz took to the boat right away.  Uncle Dave better watch out, competition for that Captain job.

It was a typical beautiful, sunny day on San Diego bay, light winds and since we could go 
during the week limited traffic.

Crazy Love with her crew made it back to the dock after a lovely sail (and most importantly 
no one took an unanticipated swim.)

We also had some fun at the world famous San Diego Zoo and Sea World.

It was a great family visit and a nice reprieve from the boat work.  Now we get serious...
just about 2 weeks till we head south!
