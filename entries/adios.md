Dave and I are in final preparations for departure to Hawaii.  It looks like a
weather window has opened for Tuesday of next week for us to get off the coast
and into the trades.  We are really, extremely excited!!

Dave installed the fans, the new VHF and wired in our GPS.  We have armed and
secured our new-to-us life raft.  I have loaded the boat down with food with
exception of fresh items such as carrots, cabbage, eggs, etc. The boat is
fueled up.  The waterline is sinking due to the added weight of our secured 50
gallons of potable water.  Our final load of laundry is being cleaned as we
write this post.  The boat is ready.  The crew is ready. We can't wait to go!

We have set up the inReach so you can track our progress.  Our intention is to
at least track our position daily and every so often leave a message on the
map.  (See the big red text at the top of this post for a link to the map). BUT
just because we haven't checked in, doesn't mean we're lost... it could mean a
number of things such as dead batteries, forgetfulness of the crew, error with
the technology, etc, etc.  Remember we have multiple ways to hail help if we
need it.  Please don't worry about us.

We plan to check out of Mexico on Monday.  This will be our last blog post
until Radio Bay, Hilo, Hawaii.

Adios Mexico. It was a great time and we hope to return soon.
