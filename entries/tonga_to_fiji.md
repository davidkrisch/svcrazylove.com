title: Tonga to Fiji
date: 2019-02-10

**Work in Progress**

Lakeba Pass - recommended by John, used by Kuan Yin
Added WP on Navionics, the pass is labeled

Also 2 other options, added markers to Navionics.  Southern one looks easy, but
would be better for Suva.   Northern one seems riskier, more reefs.


Possible WPs? From compendium
17°28’S, 178°36’W
17°31’S, 179°37’W
The don’t seem useful, ignore them
