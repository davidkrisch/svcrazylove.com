title: 34 &deg; North

Yesterday we sailed across Santa Monica Bay, passing Los Angeles in what felt
much more civilized than driving I-5 (but what isn't really?). We arrived just
after sunset to Paradise Cove WPT 34&deg;01.00"N 118&deg;47.75'W.  This is a
beautiful cove protected by Pt Dume from westerly winds along a stretch of coast
just south of Malibu, boasting extravagant homes, a beautiful sandy beach, a
small pier, one restaurant, and believe it or not.. no other boats.

Anchoring in the dark was a daunting experience in and around multiple kelp
forests.  We felt the anchor might not be dug into anything more than a couple
of large kelp plants and kept a close eye through the night. A little after
dawn, Dave and I both felt we were just a little to close for comfort to the
beach in just over 10 ft of water at a lowering tide. We moved to a much better
location between two areas of kelp (much easier to see what we're doing in the
morning light). Of course all that maneuvering through kelp got our prop tangled
again. It was my turn for the chilly morning swim to unwrap the tough plant from
around our propeller.  Getting in actually isn't the hard part its getting back
on the boat with our make shift rope ladder that is tough.

It seems there is a SW wind forecast end of this week and we feel this is a great
place to spend time till then.  I have a tasty meal planned for this evening, a
mexican style pork stew with sweet potatoes.   Then, just maybe a beach day tomorrow.
