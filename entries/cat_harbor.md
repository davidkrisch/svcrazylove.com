title: Catalina Harbor
date: 2013-06-17

Today is Monday.  Carolyn and I rounded the rocky, rugged, and undeveloped west
end of Catalina headed for Catalina Harbor on the south side of the island. We
started early - early for us is 8:30 - and pulled into our mooring at Two
Harbors at five till noon.  After a quick lunch of Mac and cheese with hot dogs
- because five year old cuisine doesn't require refrigeration - we pumped up the
dinghy and rowed to shore to explore Two Harbors and have a few $8 beers at the
only restaurant and bar in town. Today is Monday and it doesn't suck because I
was drinking beer in the sun at 2pm.

Catalina Harbor does not have its own town but instead shares the town of Two
Harbors with Isthmus Harbor about a half mile walk to the North side of the
island.  It's a small tourist town and was not busy when we arrived. There
were trucks hauling gear for campers and backpackers hauling their own gear in
the center of The main Street when we arrived.  There is only one store, the
General Store, one restaurant, Harbor Reef Restaurant and Bar, and one hotel
with 12 rooms.

How we got here...after leaving Avalon on Wednesday we headed west and ended up
in hen Rock Cove for two nights at anchor which was uneventful except for Sal
the Significant Sea Lion.  We left Sal's cove on Friday and headed West again
for a fresh weekend view. Completely by chance Crazy Love took us to Big Geiger
Cove which is leased by the great folks of the Blue Water Cruising Club.
Completely by chance, the Blue Water Cruising Club was having a weekend
long 'Invade the Isthmus' event and were expecting a decent number of folks
to anchor in their cove.  We arrived before most of the club arrived - we
were the second  boat in the anchorage - and we anchored bow and stern - as
our  cruising guide suggested - so the folks that showed up later didn't
mind Carolyn and I invading their space.  Over the course of the weekend we
met a few of the club members. We even got a dinghy ride to shore and a
tour of the 'Private No Trespassing' shore facilities. The  fine people of
the Blue Water Cruising Club were generous with their space, had great
advice for our Crazy Plan, and have crazy anchoring skills that I hope to
have one day.

Both evenings in Big Geiger cove I was woken by Sal's cousin Sally who was not
interested in boarding.  She was merely cruising the fishing grounds on the
outskirts of the anchorage for a snack.  Sally was a much more significant sea
lion than Sal so my theory is that she knew she was too big to jump (do sea
lions jump?) from the water to the boat which involves ducking under lifelines
that are 10 inches off the deck.

Anyhow, Carolyn and I are moored in a very empty Cat Harbor next to the Island
Supplier - I always wondered how stuff gets to the island - and plan to stay
here until Thursday when we, weather permitting, will continue our
circumnavigation of Santa Catalina Island.
