Today John Hurst of [Shelter Island Sign Shop](http://shelterislandsignshop.com/)
put a name and home port on Crazy Love.  The best illustration is a few photos:

Beyond the the name, there are two jobs being done simultaneously on the boat
in these photos.  The first is preparation for new bottom paint. The fellow in
the blue suit is wet sanding the bottom to make sure the new bottom paint sticks
to the boat.  The second is replacing the cutlass bearing.  This involves removing
the propeller and prop shaft.  If you look really close at the first photo you might
be able to see that there is no prop.  We're hopeful to have these jobs done by Wednesday
and have the boat back in the water in the marina by Thursday.  We shall see...
