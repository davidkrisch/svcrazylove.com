title: Heading to Mexico
date: 2013-11-18

Yesterday we left our slip at Half Moon Marina on Shelter Island in San Diego.
Carolyn and I really enjoyed staying on Shelter Island. We were close to all the
marine stores - thank you Marine Exchange, Downwind Marine, and West Marine -
and we were close to a gaggle of great eateries/drinkeries - thank you
Brigantine, Harbor Town Pub, Club Marina, and Point Break Cafe.

We didn't leave until quarter past three because we had to finish with the final
bits of preparation.  That included a trip to the grocery store, a final load of
laundry, and loading up on fuel and water.  After a few hours of organizing the
boat, we turned in our marina keys and said goodbye to slip C-112, our home for
the last 6 weeks.

We sailed South out of San Diego Bay and are currently anchored off the Zuniga
Shoal. It looks like a really good weather window this afternoon to get us to
Ensenada. We're hoping to stay at the Cruiseport Marina for three nights and get
our paperwork done on the first day we're there.  Fingers crossed!

After that, we'll explore Ensenada and prepare for the 200-some-odd mile journey
to Turtle Bay.
