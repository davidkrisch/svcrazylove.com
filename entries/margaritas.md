Dave and I have been honing our margarita recipe since we met.  We tried the
mixes.. not great. Then we worked with sweet and sour mix... still just not
right. Then we found it at a friend's 30th... the perfect margarita which
tweaked just slightly we made our very own.

__Dave and Rosie's Margarita__

* 1.5 shots Tequila. (High quality is best)
* 1 shot  Grand Marnier
* 1 shot Simple Syrup
* 1 shot fresh squeezed lime juice

Mix, served on the rocks, salt rim.

I would often buy the bag of limes at Costco and juice all of them at once with
my handy kitchen aid attachment. I'd mix up some simple syrup and combine equal parts
with lime juice.  Poured into a tupperware and kept in the freezer.  Margaritas were always
just a simple step away.  Sometimes I might
even juice in an orange or lemon with all the limes. This drink is pretty strong
so if you want a little lighter on the alcohol, a floater of squirt or fresca  is
quite delicious.

On Crazy Love we lack a few of these amenities and have gone without. But with
the convenience of an ice machine at this last marina I felt we could certainly
come up with something.

* 1 - 2 shots tequila (since we are on budget the $10 Sauza won out)
* 2 shots Crystal Light Lemonade
* Splash, Orange juice
* Lime wedge 
* Splash, club soda

I filled the glasses with ice, poured in a shot or two of tequila.  Then filled the
glass mostly full with crystal light, added a splash of orange juice, a squeeze of
lime and  topped with some club soda ( I like bubbles). This drink certainly met
my expectations. 

Someone once said we needed a bottle of rum to keep on the boat, but I must admit Crazy Love is more a tequila girl!

The margaritas accompanied our chicken fajitas quite nicely.

These were thrown together by saut√©ing onion and green pepper, hash browns  (leftover from
breakfast...I love 
[shelf stable dehydrated potatoes](http://hungryjackpotatoes.com/products/hashbrowns.php#.UiQNdWTEqJw))
 and the remains of the whole roasted chicken we had
bought for dinner the previous night.  Salsa and sour cream toppers. Fill a
tortilla, sip a margarita, and relax in the sun.  Happy Labor Day Weekend!
