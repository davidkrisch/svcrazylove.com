title: Sauerkraut...on a boat

Cabbage is one of those veggies that stores really well without refrigerating
so I'm always looking for ways to cook with it on the boat. I love sauerkraut,
it's made from  cabbage...and I found this

I thought, why couldn't we do that.

I first tried it on our Pacific passage and it turned out great.  Just mix well
with salt and wait a few days, could it really be that easy?

A few concessions on the boat. Everything was as clean as I could get it on
salt water, we didn't use fresh water for anything but drinking and
occasionally cooking. Second (and ironically), I didn't have sea salt, just
plain old Mexican table salt. Thirdly,  no cheese cloth. A  Blue paper shop
towel seemed to do the trick. I bought this jar in Mexico before we left. It
was ready in 3 days, better at 5 and gone by 7. It was great on hot dogs,
sandwiches, potatoes, and on its own.

_I highly suggest using the link above, this is how I did it on the boat_

* 1/2 head cabbage
* about 1 tblsp salt

Slice cabbage as thin as you can and put in a large bowl.  Rub in salt. Get
both your hands into it and really work it in, until it has expressed quite a
bit of liquid.  Put it in a jar, pressing it down so its all covered in liquid.
Cover with a clean paper blue shop towel (or paper towel), secure in a good
spot where it won't tip over too much and wait 3 days.

Yum!
