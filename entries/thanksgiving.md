I hope everyone had a wonderful Thanksgiving with family and friends.  Dave and
I were fortunate to be at anchor in Bah√≠a Tortugas.

As a special treat after our 6 day journey I prepared a four course celebratory
meal.

__Course 1: Salami w/ Asiago, Hard Monterey Jack, and Crackers__

__Course 2: Tuna Croquettes__

* 1 cup tuna, fresh if you got it 
* 1 cup rehydrated hashbrown potatoes 
* egg, powdered about 2 tablespoons and a little water 
* quarter onion, finely diced 
* 1 tsp mustard 
* Elbert All-Purpose Seasoning to taste (you can use seasoned salt or monterey steak seasoning) 
* corn meal 
* olive oil

I had cooked up the tuna meat we had left as I thought it would keep better
unrefrigerated once cooked as opposed to raw. Combine the cooked tuna, potatoes,
egg, onion, mustard and seasoning.  Form into cake and roll in corn meal.  Brown
in olive oil.  Serve warm with a little California Chili Sauce ... or hot sauce
of your choice.

** If I had real eggs this would have formed better cakes.  I should have added
a bit of flour to help bind them.  They tasted delicious even if they fell apart
just a little.

__Course 3: Butternut Squash Curried Soup__

* 1/2 small butternut squash, cubed 
* 1 large potato, peeled and cubed 
* 1/4 cup dried vegetable mix 
* 2 tablespoons Indian Spice Mix*** 
* Dash Cinnamon Sugar*** 
* 1 large can of chicken 
* 1 can cream of chicken condensed soup 
* 1 cup cooked rice, leftover from a previous meal 
* Salt and Pepper

Place the cubed butternut squash, potato, dried vegetables, spices, and salt in the pressure
cooker and cover with water.  Bring to pressure and cook at pressure 4 minutes
before turning the heat off and letting the pressure naturally release.  
Then add the remaining ingredients and heat until the soup just begins to simmer.

__Course 4: [Brownie Scramble](2013-07-22_But_what_about_baked_goods_.html) with Irish Coffee__

We had just a little whiskey left on the boat, really just 2 fingers.  I thought
what better way to enjoy but in an Irish Coffee with just a little warm
chocolate goodness. It wasn't pecan or pumpkin pie but it sure tasted good.
