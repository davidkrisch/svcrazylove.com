title: Boat Work: Everything Else
date: 2013-11-17

We're planning to head South tomorrow, so the boat work is coming to a close.
In fact I call it complete.  I believe we've checked most everything off Dave's
list.  We've mounted solar panels, added a battery monitor, new batteries, and
cleaned every surface on the boat.  Most recently and the last big upgrade, we
installed the WindPilot Pacific Light.

[Benchmark Custom Welding](http://benchmarkwelding.com/) did an excellent job on the design, build, and install
for this beautiful work of German engineering.

We haven't had a chance to see it in action, but there will be plenty of
miles to get it dialed in on our way to Cabo.

Some other work we've done in the last few weeks: dinghy repairs, head repairs
and essentially "put the Crazy Love back together again."

The dinghy, we call Peeps, is a beautiful 1984 Achilles in a bright blue color.
Its a good dinghy...  just not good enough for the Dinghy Doctor to repair him
for the hours and cost it would take.  So green slime (yes the tire repair goo)
worked its magic.  This cost friendly quick fix seems to have taken care of
the few slow leaks we had.  Maybe we can now row ashore without carrying
our handy hand air pump.  

The head pump was a bit leaky so we decided to rebuild it rather than install
an entire new head.  That was a lovely job!  I think we got most the pieces
back together and in the end spent the same amount as we would have on a new
one (figures!).

We got our sails and boom back from their various repairs and installed them
back on the boat.  

It seems she is a sailboat again and on Thursday afternoon, with our friend
Kevin as crew we made sure she (more likely us) could still sail.  

We're ready for Mexico and its promise of a Corona Christmas!
