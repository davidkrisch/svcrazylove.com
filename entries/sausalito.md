title: Sausalito
date: 2013-08-12

Carolyn and I wanted to explore Sausalito and we weren't confident about the
dinghy dock situation, so we got ourselves a slip at [Clipper Yacht
Harbor](http://www.clipperyacht.com) for three nights at $1/ft plus a three
dollar a night charge for power.  The nerve!  The marina was clean, with
recently renovated restrooms with heated floors and lots of hot water. The luxury!

There was a lot to do and see in Sausalito.  On our first day, we walked a mile
and a half into town for [Friday Night
Jazz](http://www.ci.sausalito.ca.us/index.aspx?page=809).  Can you believe it,
they allow alcohol in a public park.  In San Diego, we'd be considered
criminals for listening to music and having a glass of wine.  The missing
ingredient here is any sort of warmth.  When the concert started at 6:30pm, the
sun was still warm, but the cold breeze was uncomfortable even in jeans and a
jacket.  While we were still in the park we decided the Bay isn't the best home
for us when we return to real life.  I mean...if mid August isn't shorts and t-shirt weather
there's a problem unless we're talking about the Southern Hemisphere.

On Saturday, we went to the [Bay Model Visitor's
Center](http://www.spn.usace.army.mil/Missions/Recreation/BayModelVisitorCenter.aspx).
It is a warehouse sized model of the San Francisco Bay and surrounding water used
to simulate tides.  We're geeks, so we enjoyed a three hour visit.

After the Bay Model, Carolyn made an amazing Clam Chowder that she's written about
in the [In the Galley](galley.html) section on this [page](2013-08-11_Chowder_.html).

On Sunday we walked to the modest Sausalito Farmer's market at Dunphy Park.  It had
the essentials, but wasn't worth hanging around like the some of the other's we've
experienced this summer; notably Santa Cruz.

The farmer's market was on the way to town where we hopped on a bus to Mill
Valley for some beer tourism.   Our destination was [Mill Valley
Beerworks](http://millvalleybeerworks.com).  We sampled some beer, had a snack,
and walked around town.  Mill Valley is beautiful town with tall (I assume
redwoods?) trees everywhere and a town square worth checking out if you are
ever in the area.

Our trip to Mill Valley didn't last but a few hours, an enjoyable few hours,
but we had seen enough so we hopped back on the bus to Sausalito.  For dinner
in town we planned to hit a tiny restaurant with a green awning that said simply
[Hamburgers](http://www.yelp.com/biz/hamburgers-sausalito-sausalito).  The
line, for takeout only, was 25 people deep.  We waited in line on the sidewalk
for 30 minutes until we could squeeze in the door to order.  It was worth the
wait, on par with In and Out or Five Guys.
