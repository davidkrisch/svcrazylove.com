I love beets, I'm sure it's from my Eastern European heritage, but I love beets! 
This recipe was shared with me by a good friend from one of our book clubs turned supper club dinners.  Thanks Dre!

We picked up the beets and the other produce in this recipe at the Santa Cruz farmers' market. This is a delayed entry, I made this soon after we arrived in Monterey.
If you can't find golden beets you can use the red or purple ones, but it will turn your pasta pink!  It still tastes delicious.  This is a great, easy
recipe and something a little different to do with the pasta on the boat.

image[beetpasta, beets, Golden Beets with Pasta Served.]

* 1/4 cup pine nuts
* 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
* 1 large shallot (original recipe uses onion)
* 2 garlic cloves, minced
* 1 bunch 2-inch-diameter golden beets with fresh healthy greens; beets peeled, diced into large bite size pieces, greens cut into 1-inch-wide strips
_(unfortunately by the time I got around to cooking the beets for this recipe, the greens were not so healthy - in their place I added some summer squash)_
* 6-8 ounces farfalle (bow-tie pasta) or in our case whatever pasta is in the jar... a ziti mix this time
* 1/4 cup grated Asiago cheese plus additional for serving (original recipe uses parmesan), plus shavings for garnish

Toast the pine nuts over medium heat in the skillet.  Set aside.  

Cook the beets in the pressure cooker.  Cover them with water, lock the lid and heat until 15psi.  
Once up to pressure, 4 minutes cooking time and then let the pressure naturally release.  Remove the beets
from the water and set aside.  Use the beet water to boil your pasta (I had to add just a bit more water).

While the beets and pasta are cooking, Sauté the shallots, garlic, and squash in olive oil.  If the greens had still been healthy you could
sauté them with this mix as well.

When straining the pasta leave some liquid in the pot, add the sauté mix, and stir in the pasta and cheese.

Sprinkle the pine nuts over the individual serving bowls with a few shavings of cheese for garnish.  

Pepper, red pepper flakes and the parmesan pesto sprinkle (noted in a [previous entry](2013-08-18_Sometimes_Easy_and_Simple_is_Good.html)) were served on the side for added flavorings to the dish.
