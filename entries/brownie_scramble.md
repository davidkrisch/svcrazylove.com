title: But what about baked goods?

If you know us, we like to bake.  Dave has made a name for himself with his famous cinnamon
rolls and I come from a long line of Schimenecks and Dudzinskis that make excellent baked goods.

Baking without an oven...well it doesn't really work.  But when that craving hits you for
something warm with maybe a little chocolate we got creative.

__Skillet Brownie Scramble__

* 1/2 cup brownie mix
* 1 tblsp dried eggs
* 1 1/2 tblsp crisco *
* 1/4 cup water

*You can use vegetable oil, but its easy storing crisco on the boat 

Melt the crisco in a skillet. In a bowl, combine the brownie mix, egg, melted crisco, 
and water. Just enough water so the batter is a little thicker than normal brownie mix.
Pour the mix onto the heated skillet.  Mix like you would be making scrambled eggs till it
thickens enough to form a brownie patty. Flip to cook through.

Serve warm topped with vanilla yogurt or vanilla pudding or (if you are in luxury) vanilla
ice cream.



Then there are days like today that our sweet tooth took us to a Morro Bay bakery and we
indulged in a chocolate custard pastry and a cinnamon roll.  I feel we earned it after
deploying the dinghy and rowing to shore!
