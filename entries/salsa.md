As we were getting ready for our trip south from Monterey, we met some wonderful folks one
night who very generously donated to our provisions a bunch of vegetables from their home garden.  There was
cantaloupe, cabbage, chard (or some kind of greens), zucchini (the largest I've ever seen), garlic, apples,
cucumbers, and tomatoes.  Gaining this kind of produce the day before we planned to depart made our
provisioning trip so much lighter!

They apologetically said in parting, those tomatoes are going to turn soon... maybe make some salsa.

So I did!

I'm sure it was the home grown tomato goodness but this tasted so fresh and good.  We didn't 
think we'd be able to eat it all, but well we did.


__Chili Seasoning__* - One of my pre-mixed seasonings 

* Chili powder (3)
* Cumin (1)
* Cayenne pepper (a couple dashes)
