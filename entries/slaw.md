Dave requested cornbread.  What to pair with it?  Since we needed to eat up the leftover
chicken tenders from the night before I thought why not spice those up and make some cole slaw.


__Skillet Corn Bread__  _recipe adapted from [atomvoyages](http://www.atomvoyages.com/planning/recipes-and-provisioning.html)_

* 1/2 cup flour, self rising
* 1/2 cup cornmeal
* 1 tblsp dried eggs 
* 3 tblsp dried milk 
* 2 tblsp brown sugar 
* 1/2 cup water 
* 3 tblsp melted butter

Mix all the dry ingredients. Add the water and melted butter to form a thick
batter. I melt the butter in the same pan I cook the bread. Pour
batter into hot pan, forming a thick pancake. Cook over medium heat,  flipping often to 
prevent burning. I make two "cakes" with this recipe (1 for me, 1 for Dave). Serve warm, with
butter.


__Crazy Love Slaw__

* 3 tblsp Ranch dip  ([Hidden Valley's to go packs](http://www.hiddenvalley.com/products/dressings/original-ranch/to-go/) are great for storing on the boat)
* 1-2 tsp pepper relish juice
* 1/2 tsp Mustard

Mix the above ingredients together in a bowl to taste.   We bought the pepper relish at the San
Fran ferry building farmers' market from [Happy Quail Farms](http://happyquailfarms.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=featured&Itemid=435). 
The liquid from the pickled peppers added a nice sweet-sour for the slaw. I put just a dime size squirt of mustard.

Toss in the following chopped veggies (or whatever you have).

* Green Cabbage
* Carrot
* Baby Red Onion
* Padron peppers


I reheated the chicken before cooking the corn bread with a tiny amount of olive
oil and a couple dashes of my chili seasoning*.

Perfect served outside with a setting sun.

__Chili Seasoning__*

* Chili powder (3)
* Cumin (1)
* Cayenne pepper (a couple dashes)
