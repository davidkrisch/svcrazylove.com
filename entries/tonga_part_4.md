*Monday*

Rosie did provisions.  David fixed a misbehaving sheet winch, filled the fuel
tank from our single jerry jug, tensioned the alternator belt, and organized.

I'd like to brag about one thing.  We're still using the fuel we bought in
Hawaii!  There's not a lot of awesome things about being on a small boat, but
low fuel costs is one of them.  A big boat needs a fuel truck to fill up; Crazy
Love needs Davey to walk down the street with a 20 liter gas can.  We use the
motor as little as possible and our engine uses less than a liter per hour, so
the fuel we carry (60 liters) lasts a long time.  From June to November 2018,
we used less than 30 liters.

Last fish and chips with Bear at Hideaway (the pretty blue houseboat).

*Tuesday, October 9th*

Move to Anchorage 5. Stow dinghy. Skinny dipping...we had the anchorage to
