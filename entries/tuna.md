The day before Thanksgiving Dave snagged a tuna on his hand line enroute to
Turtle Bay.  Our first fish aboard Crazy Love! With respect to the catch, we
wanted to waste as little as possible.  This is made even more difficult without
refrigeration which meant we had an answer to what's for dinner?... and what's
for breakfast?... and what's for lunch?

We did our best with the cleaning.  We steaked most of the fish and filleted the
tail.  Even with our hack job we had more tuna than Dave and I could possibly
eat.

I was worried about how best to keep the fish the longest and without getting
sick.  I'm not sure if it was the right thing to do, but I felt it would last
longer cooked as opposed to raw.  The day of the catch I pan fried all the fish
with exception two choice steaks I kept separate for dinner.  Pan
fried in a little olive oil and all purpose seasoning.


__Sashimi for breakfast__

As part of Dave's "fishing kit" he ensured we picked up some wasabi before our
departure.  A little soy with a little wasabi and he was happy eating sashimi
the morning we caught the fish.  I must admit it was just a little too early for
me to eat raw fish...and the funny thing is I introduced Dave to sushi.

__Fish Burrito for lunch__

For lunch we had one lone tortilla left in our "pantry".  The tortilla warmed with a melted
slice of american cheese, piled with the pan fried fish, some shredded cabbage, carrots, ranch
dressing, a wedge of lime, and CA chili sauce was delicious!  Plenty to share
between the two of us.

__Seared Tuna for dinner__

Dinner was simple.  Seared tuna steaks with olive oil, salt and pepper and my
special stir fry sauce.  My intention was to sear these rare, however the pan
didn't quite get hot enough and they were a little more done than I would have
liked.  Very tasty nonetheless.  I served some stir fried cabbage and carrots in
the same sauce over rice.

_Stir Fry Sauce_
In equal or almost equal amounts and to taste (I have this pre-mixed in a bottle ready to go):

* Soy Sauce
* Sesame Oil
* Hoison sauce (jarred from the asian section)
* Rice wine
* Asian Chile Sauce or CA Chile Sauce (to taste for heat)

__Tuna scramble for breakfast__

* Scrambled eggs, from powder
* dried vegetable mix
* crumbled cooked tuna
* asiago or parmesan cheese
* salt and pepper

I rehydrated the vegetables in the powder egg mix with water for several
minutes.  I then cooked the eggs adding the tuna, cheese and seasoning at the
end to warm the tuna and melt the cheese.

__Tuna sandwich for lunch__

Pretty simple really.  I make this with canned tuna as well.  Sandwich bread
spread with a little laughing cow cheese wedge (these are sold non-refrigerated
and last quite long on the shelf).  I mix the tuna with some ranch dressing
(thank you hidden valley for selling individual serving sizes), mustard, and
some juice of the pickled banana peppers.  I threw some of the banana pepper
rings on the sandwich as well.  Seasoned with all-purpose seasoning and/or salt
and pepper.

__Tuna croquettes as appetizer to Thanksgiving dinner__

I had to incorporate the tuna into our Thanksgiving meal!  Course 2 it was, and you can find the recipe [here.](2013-11-29_Thanksgiving_Feast_on_the_Crazy_Love.html)

After two days and six meals... we had our fill.
