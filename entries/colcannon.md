So we made it to Santa Cruz Island, what's for dinner?

I don't typically plan specific meals for specific nights, especially when we are looking 
at provisioning for more than a week.  Rather, I try to stock ingredients that I can mix and 
match and keep things a little spontaneous in the galley.

Having lots of cabbage, I wasn't sure what to do with it so I turned to [Miss Vickie](http://www.amazon.com/Miss-Vickies-Pressure-Cooker-Recipes/dp/0764597264)
for inspiration.  First recipe under cabbage in the index: Colcannon.  It is apparently a 
traditional Irish potato and cabbage casserole.  Well we have the cabbage, we have potatoes, 
and this is what I came up with:

__Rosie's Colcannon__ (slightly adapted from Miss Vickie... ok completely bastardized from Miss Vickie's recipe)

* 2 cups green cabbage, chopped
* 3 small carrots, peeled and chopped
* 1/2 red onion, chopped
* 1/2 bunch swiss chard, chopped
* small can spam, cubed
* concentrated chicken stock, + about 2 cups water
* 1 tblsp olive oil
* Montreal Steak Seasoning
* 1 1/2 cups dried hash brown potatoes, reconstituted
* 1 1/2 cups milk (from powder)
* 2 tbslp cream cheese
* 2 tbslp sour cream


In the pressure cooker, cook the onion and spam in the olive oil till the onions soften and the spam begins to brown. 
Stir in the cabbage, carrots, and chard with the concentrated chicken stock and water (about 2 cups). 
Season with a generous amount of Montreal steak seasoning.

Lock the lid  and bring to 15psi for 4 minutes, then allow to naturally release.  In the meantime, 
heat enough water (in the teapot) to reconstitute the hash brown potatoes.  

Add the reconstituted potatoes to the pot.  Stir in the milk, cream cheese, and sour cream.  

image[overflow, colcannon, I almost overflowed the pot.  I should have cut back on the veggies or potatoes but it made plenty of food!]


I added in the cream cheese and sour cream because these needed to be used up since they were 
not refrigerated but they added a nice extra creaminess to this soup-like dish.

Did you notice I snuck in the spam?  Instead of canned meat this dish would be delicious 
with ham steak, kielbasa, or without the meat and served as a side.  

If you don't use spam a bit of salt might be needed.
