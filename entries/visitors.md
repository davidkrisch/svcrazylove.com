Visitors!!!  Alicia arrived first. We met her at PV airport and headed back to
Sayulita for a week in a beach bungalow.  Amy met us a few days later.

The food in Sayulita was amazing from the street tacos to Burrrito Revolution
to the beach donut vendor. And did I mention the churro man? Amazing!!  We even
had a little kitchen where we made good use of _una licuadora_ for smoothies in
the morning with mangos and yaca.

Hey when you live on a small boat, it's the little things you appreciate (like
a real bed too). We didn't spend the entire time eating, there was plenty of
lazing at the beach.  We also made it out to La Cruz for Sunday market and  a
day cruise with the sisters where the wildlife in the bay did not disappoint.
Thanks for sharing some of your pics Amy.

The next wave of visitors hailed from our home port of San Diego. They came in
a pack of 6 plus an Uncle. We spent the next 5 days eating and drinking to our
hearts content at an all inclusive on the beach of Nuevo Vallarta. One evening
we took a water taxi to PV proper and indulged in some fabulous Thai food from
Archie's Wok...not a taco on the menu!

It was a wonderful visit with family and friends. Thanks Alicia, Amy, Kevin,
Janet, Dennis, Lindsay, Bob, Candace, and Uncle Carroll.
