title: Farewell Santa Barbara 
date: 2013-07-08

I feel we really took advantage of our week docked in this beautiful city
nestled between beach and mountain.

After the festivities of the 4th, we wanted to get a hike in as we heard there
were some great views from the mountains and take a little break away from the
ocean.  We decided on seven falls, not too far outside the city.  It still was a
bit of an adventure to get there.  We took the bus from downtown to the
botanical gardens then had about a 3 mile trek up to the trail head.  Not a road
really meant for pedestrians but we made it. Once on the trail it was supposed
to be a 4 mile out and back, but there was a bit of a wrong turn up to
Inspiration Point.  Once back on track, it took a bit of scrambling through a
dry creek bed (this was our first clue that the 7 falls were more like 7 drips)
but we made it to the end where the 3 pools were supposed to be.  The pools
during the rainy/wet season are supposed to be fun to swim in and cool off.  I
felt it best at the time to leave the swimming to the salamanders and the pools
to the dragonflies.  After our hike and since we failed to stop for additional
change for the bus, we decided to hike it all the way back to the boat.  Have I
mentioned Dave runs 50 mile races for fun? (mile is not a typo)

Mom and Dad Krisch came up for a visit, arriving Sunday.  They helped with
some provisioning (yes, new oars!, groceries, and replacement of a blown flippy
floppy) and delivered our mail. We had great eats, a great visit, and a tour of
the maritime museum right in the harbor.

Since we've finished a few big chores on the boat (and when I say we I mean
Dave's beautiful new lifelines), played tourist in a great town, taken advantage
of the laundry and the showers...I believe we're ready to get back sailing! 
Cojo anchorage and Point Conception here we come.
