title: 10 days, 100 miles
date: 2013-06-10

Sunday morning was moving day for us.  On Saturday, we had decided against
spending the $30 on a guest slip and spent it instead at the Dana Point
Farmer's market.  Now provisioned with fresh veggies and bread we were ready to
head to Catalina Island.

Low winds in the morning gave us an opportunity to try out the spinnakerâ€¦ can
anyone say 1980s?

Dave was like a little kid with a new toy and very pleased we were able to
raise and lower this sail with little trouble thanks to the new running rig.

This is the first port we've sailed to that we had not previously been (in our
boat), and it was an offshore sail.   We are however very familiar with Avalon
harbor as almost 5 years ago Dave and I were married on this very island.

We arrived with a little daylight to spare around 8 pm and assigned mooring
ball #6, front and center to the view of Avalon.  10 days, 100 nautical miles!
We passed (thank goodness) the dye test harbor patrol flushed through our head
to ensure Avalon Harbor stays clear and clean and are set to stay through
Wednesday.

This morning we took the dinghy in and spent what I consider the best $3 on
this trip to date.
